covid|info||"This app has been rushed to production in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Local data about health risk factors, access to healthcare, social and economic inequalities, and vulnerable populations in Connecticut can help identify next steps as we all respond to this crisis. The data here were not newly collected in response to the pandemic, but are the most current available. 

Because of this rush, while the data shown are accurate, the online interface may have bugs or not work well on older browsers. We will continue to add more over the coming weeks. Contact DataHaven with questions."
